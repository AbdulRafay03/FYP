ABSTRACT = {Cricket is one of the most liked, played, encouraged, and exciting sports in todayâ€™s time that requires a proper advancement with machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to attain more accuracy. With the increasing number of matches with time, the data related to cricket matches and the individual player are increasing rapidly. Moreover, the need of using big data analytics and the opportunities of utilizing this big data effectively in many beneficial ways are also increasing, such as the selection process of players in the team, predicting the winner of the match, and many more future predictions using some machine learning models or big data techniques. We applied the machine learning linear regression model to predict the team scores without big data and the big data framework Spark ML. The experimental results are measured through accuracy, the root mean square error (RMSE), mean square error (MSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), respectively 95%, 30.2, 1350.34, and 28.2 after applying linear regression in Spark ML. Furthermore, our approach can be applied to other sports.},
