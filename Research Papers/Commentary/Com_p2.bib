abstract = {Advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV) are revolutionizing how we experience sports broadcasting. Traditionally, sports commentary has played a crucial role in enhancing viewer understanding and engagement with live games. Yet, the prospects of automated commentary, especially in light of these technological advancements and their impact on viewers’ experience, remain largely unexplored. This paper elaborates upon an innovative automated commentary system that integrates NLP and CV to provide a multimodal experience, combining auditory feedback through text-to-speech and visual cues, known as italicizing, for real-time in-game commentary. The system supports color commentary, which aims to inform the viewer of information surrounding the game by pulling additional content from a database. Moreover, it also supports play-by-play commentary covering in-game developments derived from an event system based on CV. As the system reinvents the role of commentary in sports video, we must consider the design and implications of multimodal artificial commentators. A focused user study with eight participants aimed at understanding the design implications of such multimodal artificial commentators reveals critical insights. Key findings emphasize the importance of language precision, content relevance, and delivery style in automated commentary, underscoring the necessity for personalization to meet diverse viewer preferences. Our results validate the potential value and effectiveness of multimodal feedback and derive design considerations, particularly in personalizing content to revolutionize the role of commentary in sports broadcasts.},
